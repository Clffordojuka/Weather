# Weather
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of weather data. The primary objective is to explore and understand various weather patterns and their potential impact on different factors such as temperature, humidity, visibility, and more. The dataset used for this analysis contains various weather-related attributes, recorded over a significant period.

Project Objectives
Data Cleaning: Cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and other inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting EDA to gain insights into the data and understand the underlying patterns.
Data Visualization: Using various visualization techniques to represent data insights effectively.
Statistical Analysis: Performing statistical analysis to understand the relationship between different weather attributes.
Weather Condition Analysis: Grouping data by weather conditions and calculating the mean values of various attributes for each weather condition.
Steps and Methodology
Loading the Dataset:

Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Displaying the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or dropping them.
Removing any duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generating summary statistics for numerical columns.
Plotting histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize data distributions and relationships.
Data Visualization:

Creating line plots to visualize temperature and humidity trends over time.
Using bar charts to compare the average values of various attributes for different weather conditions.
Statistical Analysis:

Calculating correlation coefficients to understand the strength and direction of relationships between numerical attributes.
Conducting hypothesis tests to determine if observed patterns are statistically significant.
Weather Condition Analysis:

Grouping data by Weather_Condition and calculating the mean values of attributes like temperature, humidity, visibility, etc.
Analyzing how different weather conditions affect these attributes.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: Programming language used for the entire analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scipy: For statistical analysis.
Key Findings
Temperature Trends: Observed seasonal variations in temperature.
Humidity Patterns: Identified periods of high and low humidity and their correlation with other attributes.
Visibility Analysis: Analyzed how weather conditions like fog and rain impact visibility.
Impact of Weather Conditions: Found significant differences in temperature, humidity, and visibility across different weather conditions.
Conclusion
This project provides a detailed analysis of weather data, offering valuable insights into how different weather conditions impact various attributes. The findings can be useful for meteorologists, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding weather patterns.
